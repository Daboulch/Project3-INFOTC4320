Your team’s job is to create a python application that queries the Alpha Vantage api, and allows the user to select a date range to view the data, and the type of chart they want to view the data in. 

The application should:

Ask the user to enter the stock symbol for the company they want data for. \
Ask the user for the chart type they would like. \
Ask the user for the time series function they want the api to use. \
Ask the user for the beginning date in YYYY-MM-DD format. \
Ask the user for the end date in YYYY-MM-DD format. \
The end date should not be before the begin date \
Generate a graph and open in the user’s default browser.
